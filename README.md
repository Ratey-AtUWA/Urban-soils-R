# Urban-soils-R
R code to make selected figures and do associated data analysis (e.g. geostatistics) from my "Urban Soils" textbook

Eventually the code will be available as html (via R Markdown) on [my GitHub pages](https://github.com/Ratey-AtUWA).

I'll probably leave all the ordinary code here though ðŸ¤“
